# Spam and Ham Detection using Machine Learning

Hello everyone! I hope this project serves as an excellent starting point for those of you interested in machine learning and natural language processing.

## Project Overview
* *Project Title:* Spam and Ham Detection using Machine Learning
* *Description:* This project focuses on detecting spam messages. Using a machine learning model, we classify messages as either spam (unwanted email) or ham (legitimate email).
* *Technologies Used:* Python

## Features:
1. *Message Classification:* Categorize messages as spam or ham based on their content.
2. *Pattern Recognition:* Analyze patterns and common traits in messages that are typically marked as spam.

## Data Format
